# Employee Retention Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing employee retention using a Logistic Regression model. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about employees, such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in the company, work accident history, promotion in the last 5 years, department, and salary.

## Tasks
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load libraries and data.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identify variables impacting employee retention.
   - Visualize correlations and patterns in the data.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Separate dependent and independent variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Implement a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
   - Handle categorical variables with one-hot encoding.
   - Address convergence warnings and scale numerical features.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Make predictions on the test set.
   - Measure the accuracy of the model.
   - Display confusion matrix and classification report.
